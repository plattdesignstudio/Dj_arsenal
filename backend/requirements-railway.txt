# Railway-optimized requirements
# Excludes heavy audio processing libraries that require system dependencies
# These features will gracefully degrade if libraries are missing

# Core API

# Note: Audio processing libraries (librosa, scipy, essentia, keyfinder, aubio)
# are excluded here because they require system dependencies (gfortran, etc.)
# The application will work without them - audio analysis features will be disabled
# If you need audio analysis, consider using a different deployment platform
# or installing system dependencies via nixpacks.toml
